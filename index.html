            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p> My name is Angelina Santiago, I am an Emerging Media Technology major with a concentration in Game Design and Interactive Media. I have many interests when it comes to the creative
                field. Which I hope to be able to convey through this portfolio. My portfolio is to not only show off my work but my personal style and aesthetic. I have worked on projects in <i>game design, 
                communications design, art, and writing</i>. Within this portfolio you'll see a glimpse into the work I've done and current projects I am working on.
